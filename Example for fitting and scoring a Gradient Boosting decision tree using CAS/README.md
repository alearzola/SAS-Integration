# Example for fitting and scoring a Gradient Boosting decision tree using CAS
This exammple shows situations of how to extract data from a memory-table in CAS to work with it in R and Python, and to use it, for example, to plot. 
NHANES - PAD: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) - Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)
Data collection: Household screener, interview, and physical examination
Objectives: Understand the survey data and create a predictive model to identify the main factors that are related to the disease. The model can also be useful to prioritize the physical exams and to support the diagnostics.
Activities:
- Start the session
- Prepare the data for Modelling
- Data Partition (Training and Validation)
- Feature Engineering (add additional features)
- Modelling
- Scoring
